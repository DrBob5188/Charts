# Charts
Methods for Creating Charts for reports and presentations
A repository of scripts, vba code, excel workbooks etc to automate creation of charts.
## Rationale
Telling a story about the performance of a project/program or requesting more resources from
management requires a short sharp presentation.  Since a picture tells a thousand words this is something
I needed to get better at, but the investment in time to create them is always too high. A little bit of automation
and templating was in order.  This repository is the result of my first effort in producing a gauge chart.
A bubble chart like Andrew Jaquith's @stake Business Impact Matrix done with powershell will be next after cleaning up the format.
